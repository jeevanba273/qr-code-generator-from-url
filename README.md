## How It Works

QR Forge leverages the power of several technologies to deliver a seamless QR code generation experience:

1. **Input Handling**: Enter any text or URL into the input field.
2. **QR Code Generation**: The `qrcode.react` library processes your input and generates a QR code SVG.
3. **Customization**: Apply additional customizations like adding text, logos, or adjusting resolution.
4. **Export Options**: Convert the SVG to PNG for downloading or copying to clipboard.

### Technical Implementation

- **React Components**: Modular component structure for maintainability and code reuse.
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering the final QR code with text and logo additions.
- **Clipboard API**: Enables direct copying of the generated QR code to clipboard.
- **Advanced Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients for a polished UI.
